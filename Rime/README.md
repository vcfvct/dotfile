## basic custom files for Rime
* simp(明月- 简体) only

Path should be `~/Library/Rime/` in MacOS.
In the options, `Sync user data` then `Deploy`.

Log is under `$TMPDIR/` with name like `rime.squirrel.INFO/ERROR/WARNING`.

[install in different devices/systems](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_34238642/article/details/94523592)

## sync
* to sync between devices, just need to cp these files to `~/Library/Rime`. Tweak or comment-out the `sync_dir` field in `installation.yaml`.
