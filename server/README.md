## Local http server
This is similar to `python3 http.server`. Just some more customizations.

### Setup
Put the file to the `python3` bin like `~/Library/Python/3.7/bin` if you install via `brew`. And rename it to `serve`, then `chmod +x serve`.

### Usage
> Now we can just run `serve` from any directory. 


> Or `serve 3000` to run on custom port like `3000`. 


> Or `serve dist` to run in the currnet `dist` folder as root.


> Or `serve dist 8888` to run in current `dist` and `8888` port.
